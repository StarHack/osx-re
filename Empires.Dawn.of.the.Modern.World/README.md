Empires: Dawn of the Modern World - Keygen/Key Generator
==============
This is the reverse engineered serial key algorithm of Empires: Dawn of the Modern World.

While the first four blocks are computed in the same manner the last block fungates as sort of a 4-digit checksum which is simply appended to the end of the serial.

The reason for the `%16` in the `nextChar()` function is to map the output to a character in the alphabet.

You may compile this using any C compiler, i.e. on macOS we may use **clang**:

```
cc empires.c -o empires-keygen && ./empires-keygen
```

or on *nix systems **gcc**:

```
gcc empires.c -o empires-keygen && ./empires-keygen
```
